    <p>Inspired by <a href="https://billwurtz.com">Bill Wurtz's Website</a><br><blockquote>your reaction here may be <i>"Holy shit you just copied his website style one for one"</i> and to this I say: It's not my fault that this is <i>objectively</i> the most bestest format for a website. I hate websites that put 90% of their resources into looking good. Reading a web page should be a whole commitment, if the user isn't <i>utterly terrified every time they look at the screen</i>, then what's even the point?. (Also this is kinda just what every barebones html website looks like so</blockquote></p>
    <p><strong>This site uses <i>Matt McAdam's <a href="https://github.com/MattMcAdams/CSS-Boilerplate">Modern CSS Boilerplate</a>.</i> It's really nice. You should use it.</strong></p
    <p><strong>Thanks to <i>Michael Pilgaard for his <a href="https://html-shark.com/JavaScripts/RandomSelector.htm">guide on randomizing splash elements</a>.</i></strong></p
