                    <strong>I need to access my songs</strong>
                    <ul>
                    <li>I have like a billion recordings and they're all split between 5 differenct machines and 4 different platforms. <br>this is the end-all be-all fuck-all repository for everything musical I have ever created.</li>
                    <li>it come with eggroll</li>

                <li><strong>I want people to hear my songs but I also don't</strong>
                    <ul>
                    <li>by creating the most user-unfriendly experience possible, the only people who get to hear my music<br> are the cool people who like me already and are willing to dig through this horrible site. Bill Wurtz pioneered <br>this technique and so I've just copied his tactic.</li>
